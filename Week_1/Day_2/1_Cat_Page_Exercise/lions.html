        <p>Present in Africa and India, the lion typically inhabits grasslands and savannahs, but is absent in dense
            forests. It is
            usually more diurnal than other big cats, but when persecuted adapts to being active at night and at
            twilight. A lion
            pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. Prides vary in size and composition from
            three to 20
            adult lions, depending on habitat and prey availability. Females cooperate when hunting and prey mostly on
            large
            ungulates, including antelope, deer, buffalo, zebra and even giraffe</p>
