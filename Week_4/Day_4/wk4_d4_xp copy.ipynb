    "\n",
    "# (1) Create a function called get_random_temp().\n",
    "#   (a) This function should return an integer between -10 and 40 degrees (Celsius), selected at random.\n",
    "#   (b) Test your function to make sure it generates expected results.\n",
    "\n",
    "# (2) Create a function called main().\n",
    "#   (a) Inside this function, call get_random_temp() to get a temperature, and store its value in a variable.\n",
    "#   (b) Inform the user of the temperature in a friendly message, eg. “The temperature right now is 32 degrees Celsius.”\n",
    "\n",
    "# (3) Let’s add more functionality to the main() function. Write some friendly advice relating to the temperature:\n",
    "#   (a) below zero (eg. “Brrr, that’s freezing! Wear some extra layers today”)\n",
    "#   (b) between zero and 16 (eg. “Quite chilly! Don’t forget your coat”)\n",
    "#   (c) between 16 and 23\n",
    "#   (d) between 24 and 32\n",
    "#   (e) between 32 and 40\n",
    "\n",
    "# (4) Change the get_random_temp() function:\n",
    "#   (a) Add a parameter to the function, named ‘season’.\n",
    "#   (b) Inside the function, instead of simply generating a random number between -10 and 40, set lower and upper limits based on the season, eg. if season is ‘winter’, temperatures should only fall between -10 and 16.\n",
    "#   (c) Now that we’ve changed get_random_temp(), let’s change the main() function:\n",
    "#       (i) Before calling get_random_temp(), we will need to decide on a season, so that we can call the function correctly. Ask the user to type in a season - ‘summer’, ‘autumn’ (you can use ‘fall’ if you prefer), ‘winter’, or ‘spring’.\n",
    "#       (ii) Use the season as an argument when calling get_random_temp().\n",
    "\n",
    "# (5) Bonus: Give the temperature as a floating-point number instead of an integer.\n",
    "# (6) Bonus: Instead of asking for the season, ask the user for the number of the month (1 = January, 12 = December). Determine the season according to the month.\n",
