Below are a few questions to assist you with your code:\n","\n","1. Create a class called Farm. How should it be implemented?\n","2. Does the Farm class need an __init__ method? If so, what parameters should it take?\n","3. How many methods does the Farm class need?\n","4. Do you notice anything interesting about the way we are calling the add_animal method? What parameters should this function have? How many…?\n","5. Test your code and make sure you get the same results as the example above.\n","6. Bonus: nicely line the text in columns as seen in the example above. Use string formatting.\n","\n","\n","Expand The Farm:\n","\n","1. Add a method called get_animal_types to the Farm class. This method should return a sorted list of all the animal types (names) in the farm. With the example above, the list should be: ['cow', 'goat', 'sheep'].\n","\n","2. Add another method to the Farm class called get_short_info. This method should return the following string: “McDonald’s farm has cows, goats and sheeps.”. The method should call the get_animal_types function to get a list of the animals.\n","    \n","    Note : In English the plural form of the word “sheep” is sheep.
